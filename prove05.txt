Matching passwords doesn't work for existing user for some reason. Still trying to figure that out.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Mongoose is a pretty efficient way of interacting with the DB, if you know how to use it.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
It was difficult to switch to using mongoose without a lot of instructions. I couldn't figure out why it was telling me a method didn't exist until I researched it, and found out I should be using schema.statics instead of schema.methods.
